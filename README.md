# Dataset
[Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)

We are using the Yelp dataset which has data for over 5,200,000 reviews, 174,000 businesses, 200,000 pictures, 11 metropolitan areas, and 1,300,000 users. The data is separated across six json files:
```
business.json
checkin.json
photos.json
review.json
tip.json
user.json
```

# Significance
We want to figure out what factors influence a NYC business' rating on Yelp and find similarities between highly rated businesses.

# Data Visualization
**Scatter Plot:** Number of Photos (x) vs. Average Rating (y)

Compares the number of photos to the average rating of each business to find a correlation.

When a user hovers over a data point, information about the corresponding business is shown.


**Pie Chart:** Density of stores by NYC neighborhood

Shows the percentage of businesses located in each NYC neighborhood.

When a user hovers over a section, the section enlarges and shows the number of businesses located in that neighborhood.


**Heatmap:** Business Checkins per day of week

Shows the frequency of checkins by hour for each day of the week.

When a user hovers over a shaded box, the number of checkins will be displayed.
